	/**
	 * For getting the latest time that has been buffered, we need the buffered IDL attribute. It returns a 
	 * TimeRanges object which has a length attribute, a start() method and an end() method. In normal cases, 
	 * there will only be one range â€” the browser starts downloading from time 0, and the downloaded range 
	 * extends to however much is currently available. However, if the user seeks forward, the browser can 
	 * stop the current download and start a new request for a later part of the video. In this case, there 
	 * would be two ranges of buffered data.
	 * 
	 * The TimeRanges object's length IDL attribute returns how many ranges there are. The start() method 
	 * takes an argument index, where 0 represents the index of the first range, 1 represents the index of 
	 * the second range, and so forth. It returns the start time of the range with the given index. The end() 
	 * method similarly returns the end time of the range with the given index.
